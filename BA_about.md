# About Our Team

Welcome to the About page of our team's GitHub Pages! We are a team passionate about computer science and technology, with a focus on exploring the concept of staying healthy and fit. 

## Mission

Our mission is to make tracking personal fitness easier and more fun through the use of games, inuitive trackers, and AI prediction assistance. 

## Current Project

- **Feature 1: Team Sport/Water Polo Stats**
  Uses a combination of AI and SQL databases to collect and display stats of individual players to better help teams track individual players and potential strengths.

- **Feature 2: AI Fitness Calorie Predictor**
  Takes basic stats on an exercise including duration and intensity to predict the number of calories burned by a user.

- **Feature 3: Fantasy Game**
  Fantasy themed game where a user must guess the location and beat an AI in a fight. The goal of the game is to better engage users in the tracking app.

## Future Plans

Our team is excited about the future and has ambitious plans ahead:
- Allow a coin system between all 3 features
    -  Coins earned from increasing stats of players
    -  Coins earned from productive exercises
    -  Coins used to get powerups in the game
- Allow the .csv file to be continually updated to give individual AI prediction
